# 2026-02-21 — Initial Hardening Session

## What Happened
- Audited entire OpenClaw configuration for 24/7 stability
- Found gateway was running (PID 8968) but scheduled task was NOT registered
- Identified port conflict handling existed but had race conditions
- Improved gateway.cmd with structured logging, log rotation, exponential backoff, safer port-kill logic
- Consolidated 4 register-task scripts into 1
- Scheduled task registration failed (needs admin UAC) → used Startup folder shortcut instead
- Populated all workspace .md files: IDENTITY, USER, TOOLS, HEARTBEAT
- Created MEMORY.md for long-term context

## Files Modified
- `gateway.cmd` — major rewrite (v2026.2.19-3)
- `register-task.ps1` — consolidated
- `workspace/IDENTITY.md` — populated
- `workspace/USER.md` — populated
- `workspace/TOOLS.md` — populated
- `workspace/HEARTBEAT.md` — added periodic checks
- `workspace/MEMORY.md` — created

## Session 2: Identity & Soul
- Santi customized IDENTITY.md — agent is "Benito", systems-layer intelligence
- Santi customized USER.md — detailed operational profile and preferences
- SOUL.md personalized: operating contract aligned with Santi's direct, systems-first style
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted — all bootstrap steps fulfilled

## Session 3: Task Scheduling Setup
- Created `workspace/TASKS.md` for persistent task tracking
- Created `workspace/SCHEDULING.md` with comprehensive scheduling guide
- Updated `HEARTBEAT.md` to include task review in rotation
- Created 4 starter cron jobs:
  - **Morning Routine** (9 AM daily) — Reviews agenda and tasks → Telegram group -5272386633
  - **Weekly Backup Reminder** (10 AM Monday) — Backup reminder → Telegram group -5272386633
  - **End of Day Summary** (5 PM weekdays) — Daily accomplishment review → Telegram group -5272386633
  - **System Health Check** (every 4h) — Silent monitoring (no delivery)
- Approved 2 Telegram pairing codes (IDs: 8293593494, 8214747689)
- Updated all cron jobs to deliver to Telegram group chat
