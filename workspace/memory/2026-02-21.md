# 2026-02-21 — Initial Hardening Session

## What Happened
- Audited entire OpenClaw configuration for 24/7 stability
- Found gateway was running (PID 8968) but scheduled task was NOT registered
- Identified port conflict handling existed but had race conditions
- Improved gateway.cmd with structured logging, log rotation, exponential backoff, safer port-kill logic
- Consolidated 4 register-task scripts into 1
- Scheduled task registration failed (needs admin UAC) → used Startup folder shortcut instead
- Populated all workspace .md files: IDENTITY, USER, TOOLS, HEARTBEAT
- Created MEMORY.md for long-term context

## Files Modified
- `gateway.cmd` — major rewrite (v2026.2.19-3)
- `register-task.ps1` — consolidated
- `workspace/IDENTITY.md` — populated
- `workspace/USER.md` — populated
- `workspace/TOOLS.md` — populated
- `workspace/HEARTBEAT.md` — added periodic checks
- `workspace/MEMORY.md` — created

## Session 2: Identity & Soul
- Santi customized IDENTITY.md — agent is "Benito", systems-layer intelligence
- Santi customized USER.md — detailed operational profile and preferences
- SOUL.md personalized: operating contract aligned with Santi's direct, systems-first style
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted — all bootstrap steps fulfilled

## Open Items
- [ ] Consider moving secrets out of plaintext config files
- [ ] Add external health check (e.g., cron job that pings gateway)
- [ ] Test gateway recovery from simulated crash
- [x] ~~Delete BOOTSTRAP.md~~ — done
- [ ] Populate cron/jobs.json with useful recurring tasks
- [ ] Clean up register-task{2,3,4}.ps1 (superseded by consolidated register-task.ps1)
